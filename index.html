    <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        This website is for practice and showcasing my <span>awesome</span> abilities. <!--notice the span here. it's an inline wrappter, kind of like the div for targeted styling-->

  <h3>Bold and Italicize</h3>
    <p>
      Here is an example of <strong>a strong bold</strong> versus a <b>regular bold</b> <!--there is no difference in the appearance but the semantic difference behind the scenes is important-->
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example of an <em>emphasized italicize</em> versus a <i>regular italicize</i> <!--again, there is no differenc in appearance. semantically, it's really important.-->
